# nodOSC

This repository will contain firmware and hardware designs for a small wireless head tracker that sends look direction information over OSC.

This project is in its very early stages, with more planned work to come.

This head tracker currently uses the following components: 
* Particle Photon 
* Sparkfun Photon Battery Shield
* Adafruit Flora LSM303DLHC Accelerometer + Compass
* 850mAh FT682743P battery

Eventually I may design a version with a custom battery and LSM303 motherboard, and a chasis to fit.
